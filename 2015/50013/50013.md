# 一段很難理解的題目敘述
Also you need to set the rowColumn variable as the smallest row and column index if you have a bingo. If you have the third condition, you should set rowColumn to 0 for the diagonal from (0, 0) to (7, 7), and 1 for the diagonal from (0, 7) to (7, 0). Note that (0, 0) is the upper left corner of the board. If you have both, then set rowColumn to 0.

解釋：
在row時有設定的話 column就不用調整了
如果有對角線的話，直接調整RowColumn
如果兩條對角線都有的話，調整為0
